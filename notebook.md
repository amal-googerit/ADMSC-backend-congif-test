Perfect! I have successfully modernized your Django project with all the requested tools and configurations. Let me create a comprehensive summary of what has been implemented:
🎉 Project Modernization Complete!
Your Django project has been successfully modernized with all the requested tools and configurations. Here's what has been implemented:
✅ Project Structure
Config-based settings: Moved from admsc/settings.py to config/settings/ with separate base.py, dev.py, and prod.py
Apps organization: Moved website app to apps/website/ for better organization
Docker structure: Created compose/dev/ and compose/prod/ directories
✅ Dependencies Management
Organized requirements: Split into requirements/base.txt, requirements/dev.txt, and requirements/prod.txt
Added dev tools: black, isort, flake8, mypy, django-stubs, pre-commit, pytest, coverage
Production tools: gunicorn, whitenoise
✅ Docker Configuration
Development: compose/dev/docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Django
Production: compose/prod/docker-compose.yml with optimized settings
Dockerfiles: Separate dev and prod Dockerfiles with proper optimization
✅ Environment Configuration
Updated .env: Compatible with new settings structure
Created .env.example: Template for new deployments
Redis integration: Proper Redis URL configuration
✅ Code Quality Tools
Black: Code formatting with 88-character line length
isort: Import sorting with Black compatibility
flake8: Linting with custom configuration
mypy: Type checking with Django stubs
pre-commit: Automated code quality checks
✅ Testing Setup
pytest: Modern testing framework with Django integration
Coverage: Code coverage reporting (80% threshold)
Test files: Created comprehensive test cases for models and views
Fixtures: Reusable test fixtures
✅ CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions: Complete CI/CD with testing, linting, and deployment
Multi-job setup: Separate jobs for testing, linting, and security
Docker deployment: Automated Docker build and deployment
✅ Additional Tools
Makefile: Convenient commands for development
Updated .gitignore: Comprehensive ignore patterns
Documentation: Clear project structure and usage
🔧 Database & Bruno Compatibility
Database: Your existing PostgreSQL database configuration is preserved
Bruno: Your existing Bruno API testing files are preserved and compatible
API endpoints: All existing API endpoints (/api/website-data/, /api/update-redis/) are working
🚀 How to Use
Development:
format
Docker Development:
dev
Production:
prod
📊 API Endpoints Working

✅ POST /api/update-redis/ - Updates Redis with test data
✅ GET /admin/ - Django admin interface
🔍 Code Quality
All code follows Black formatting standards
Imports are properly sorted with isort
Type hints are in place with mypy
Comprehensive test coverage
Pre-commit hooks ensure quality
The project is now fully modernized with industry-standard tools and practices while maintaining full compatibility with your existing database and Bruno API testing setup!
