# üéõÔ∏è Manual Deployment Workflow

This document explains the manual deployment workflow where you (amal-googerit) control the deployment process and use GitHub Actions buttons to manage PRs.

## üìã Overview

The workflow is designed to give you complete control over deployments:

1. **PR is merged** ‚Üí Notification posted in PR
2. **You manually pull** changes on your development server
3. **You test and set health status** (GOOD or BAD)
4. **Based on health status**, different buttons appear in PR
5. **You can revert, delete branch, or deploy to production**

---

## üîÑ Complete Workflow

### 1. PR Creation & Checks

When a PR is created:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[PR Created] --> B[Quick Quality Checks]
    B --> C[Full CI/CD Pipeline]
    C --> D[Security Scan]
    D --> E[Code Quality]
    E --> F[Tests]
    F --> G[CodeRabbit Analysis]
    G --> H[Ready for Merge]
```

### 2. PR Merge & Notification

When PR is merged to main:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[PR Merged] --> B[Notification Posted]
    B --> C[Manual Pull Required]
    C --> D[You SSH to Dev Server]
    D --> E[You Pull Changes]
    E --> F[You Test Application]
    F --> G{Health Check}
    G -->|Good| H[Set Health GOOD]
    G -->|Bad| I[Set Health BAD]
    H --> J[Deploy to Production Button]
    I --> K[Revert/Delete Buttons]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Process

### Step 1: PR is Merged

- ‚úÖ **Automatic notification** posted in PR
- ‚úÖ **Instructions provided** for manual deployment
- ‚úÖ **Management interface** shows available actions

### Step 2: You Manually Deploy

SSH to your development server:

```bash
# SSH to your development server
ssh user@your-dev-server

# Navigate to app directory
cd /opt/admsc-backend-dev

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Restart services
docker compose -f compose/prod/docker-compose.yml down
docker compose -f compose/prod/docker-compose.yml up --build -d

# Test the application
curl http://localhost:8000/health/
curl http://localhost:8000/api/website-data/
```

### Step 3: Set Health Status

Use the health status script:

```bash
# Set health status to GOOD (if everything works)
./scripts/set-health-status.sh 123 GOOD

# Set health status to BAD (if something fails)
./scripts/set-health-status.sh 123 BAD
```

Or use the API directly:

```bash
# Set health status to GOOD
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/health/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: amal-googerit" \
  -d '{"status": "GOOD", "pr_number": "123"}'

# Set health status to BAD
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/health/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: amal-googerit" \
  -d '{"status": "BAD", "pr_number": "123"}'
```

## üéõÔ∏è PR Management Buttons

### If Health Status is BAD

The following buttons will appear in the PR (only visible to @amal-googerit):

#### üîÑ Revert PR
- **Action**: Reverts the PR changes from main branch
- **Result**: Main branch goes back to previous commit
- **PR Status**: Becomes un-merged

#### üóëÔ∏è Delete Branch
- **Action**: Deletes the feature branch
- **Result**: Removes all changes made in the branch
- **PR Status**: Branch is deleted

### If Health Status is GOOD

The following button will appear in the PR (only visible to @amal-googerit):

#### üöÄ Deploy to Production
- **Action**: Triggers automated production deployment
- **Result**: Deploys current main branch to production server
- **Process**: Full automated deployment with health checks

# Set health status to BAD
./scripts/set-health-status.sh 123 BAD
```

#### Method 2: Using the API

```bash
# Set health status to GOOD
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/health/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: amal-googerit" \
  -d '{"status": "GOOD", "pr_number": "123"}'

# Set health status to BAD
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/health/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

# Check specific PR health status
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/health/status/?pr_number=123"
```

---

## üîí Security & Permissions

### User Restrictions

- **Only @amal-googerit** can see and use the management buttons
- **Only @amal-googerit** can set health status via API
- **Only @amal-googerit** can trigger management actions

### Authentication

The system uses multiple authentication methods:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Uses GitHub's built-in authentication
2. **API Endpoints**: Checks for amal-googerit in User-Agent
3. **Script Execution**: Validates username before running

---

## üì± API Endpoints

### Health Status Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/health/status/` | Get current health status |
| `POST` | `/api/health/set/` | Set health status (amal-googerit only) |

### Example API Usage

```bash
# Get health status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/status/

# Set health status (requires amal-googerit authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/health/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: amal-googerit" \
  -d '{"status": "GOOD", "pr_number": "123"}'
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "No jobs run" on PR
**Cause**: Workflow not properly configured
**Solution**: Check workflow triggers and file paths

#### 2. Health status not updating
**Cause**: API not accessible or authentication failed
**Solution**: Check if Django app is running and accessible

#### 3. Management buttons not visible
**Cause**: Not logged in as amal-googerit
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as @amal-googerit

#### 4. Script permission denied
**Cause**: Script not executable
**Solution**: Run `chmod +x scripts/set-health-status.sh`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if API is accessible
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/status/

# Check Django logs
docker compose logs -f web

# Check Redis status
docker compose logs -f redis

# Test health status setting
./scripts/set-health-status.sh 123 GOOD
```

---

## üìã Best Practices

### 1. Testing Before Setting Health Status

Always test thoroughly before setting health status:

```bash
# Test all endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/
curl http://localhost:8000/api/website-data/
curl http://localhost:8000/api/update-redis/

# Test database connectivity
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell

# Test Redis connectivity
docker compose exec redis redis-cli ping
```

### 2. Setting Health Status

- **Set GOOD** only after thorough testing
- **Set BAD** immediately if any issues are found
- **Test all critical functionality** before marking as GOOD

### 3. Using Management Buttons

- **Revert immediately** if health check fails
- **Delete branch** if the changes are not needed
- **Deploy to production** only after successful dev testing

### 4. Monitoring

- **Check application logs** after deployment
- **Monitor health status** regularly
- **Test all endpoints** after changes
